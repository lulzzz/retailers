> Retailers is a messy compilation of PHP, jQuery and SCSS. It uses various dependencies. If you can dissect it, you can use it. This was application built to further my knowledge in back-end languages, unfortunetly I hadn't learned of Elixir and functional programming at the time this was developed. Some batty boy at Shopify never approved it

# Retailers
